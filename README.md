# RL_fishwbowl
A player in a 2D world in the shape of a sphere, that we refer to as the fishbowl, and characterised as a blue ball, tries to learn how to avoid contacting with the enemies, red balls, as that would kill it. It does so by using Reinforcement Learning to improve its moving strategies so as to maximize the time he spends before being touched by an enemy.
